   If you havenâ€™t already downloaded the installer \(`Docker Desktop Installer.exe`\), you can get it from [**Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/). It typically downloads to your `Downloads` folder, or you can run it from the recent downloads bar at the bottom of your web browser.  

2. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to accept the license, authorize the installer, and proceed with the install.

   When prompted, authorize the Docker Desktop Installer with your system password during the install process. Privileged access is needed to install networking components, links to the Docker apps, and manage the Hyper-V VMs.
